# YouTube Trending Videos Scraper
Scrape top 10 trending videos on YouTube using **Selenium** and Automate the process using **Github Actions with CRON.**


Initially, we tried to scrape contents using **BeautifulSoup4** but it was not successful, since the page's dynamic.
We have to use **Selenium** to scrape.
